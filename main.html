	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its execution as a function of the size of its input. It is a crucial metric for evaluating a efficient and scalability of an algorithm</p>

	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute, including both the space used by the input and any auxiliary (temporary) space needed during its operation. It is typically expressed using O(n) Big O notation, which describes the upper bound or worst-case growth rate of memory usage as the input size increases.</p>
